        <article>
          <p class="highContrastTarget">Samsung Electronics developed 108MP and 200MP ISOCELL image sensors to help people take brilliantly detailed, ultra-high resolution photos using only their smartphones. We wondered: what’s the best way to show people how powerful ISOCELL sensors can be? We decided to create a specially designed photobooth so people could see for themselves how detailed photos taken with these sensors are.</p>

            Ever wonder why image sensors are so<br class="ta_only m_only" /> important to the performance of smartphone<br class="ta_only m_only" /> cameras? It’s all about size and quality<br class="ta_only m_only" /> including detail. With up to 200 million pixels, <br class="ta_only m_only" />the ISOCELL image sensor lets users take<br class="ta_only m_only" /> absolutely massive photos of up to approx.<br class="ta_only m_only" /> 16,000 by 12,000 pixels. Since a photo taken in<br class="ta_only m_only" /> these dimensions is 16 times bigger than those <br class="ta_only m_only" />taken in 12MP, it will have far more details than<br class="ta_only m_only" /> images taken with other smartphone cameras.
