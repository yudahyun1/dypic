              Samsung SSD complies the International Disk Drive Equipment and Materials Association (IDEMA) standard, which classifies approximately 93 percent of SSD’s actual physical memory capacity as a usable storage space. In order to make it easier for consumers to calculate, Samsung manufactures drive capacity based on the assumption that 1 GB is equal to 1,000 Megabytes (MB) not to 1,024 MB. When estimating a capacity, the OS calculates based up on 1,024 MB, resulting in the discrepancy
              between the reported capacity versus the actual capacity.
